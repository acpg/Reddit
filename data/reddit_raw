If CIA implants, Command & Control and Listening Post software were classified, then CIA officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the Internet. Consequently the CIA has secretly made most of its cyber spying/war code unclassified. The U.S. government is not able to assert copyright either, due to restrictions in the U.S. Constitution. This means that cyber 'arms' manufactures and computer hackers can freely \"pirate\" these 'weapons' if they are obtained. The CIA has primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect its malware secrets.\n\nOne of the more interesting passages. The arsenal must not be classified to protect those who deploy it from legal action. This cyberwarfare kit, which can just as easily be used to destroy the US as one of its enemies, is public domain software created and released at US taxpayer expense.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> The CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation.\n> \n> With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the \"fingerprints\" of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from.\n\nThis has interesting implications for the claim that \"Russians\" hacked the election (although I can't imagine the CIA wanting to hack the election in Trump's favour).", "Who's shocked?

["Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht", "2017-05-22T14:29:25", 14449, 2324, ["Ross William Ulbricht\u00a0(born March 27, 1984) is a former\u00a0darknet market\u00a0operator, best known for being convicted of creating and running the\u00a0Silk Road\u00a0website until his arrest.\u00a0He was known under the\u00a0pseudonym\"Dread Pirate Roberts\".\n\nUlbricht was convicted of\u00a0money laundering,computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics in February 2015.\u00a0He is currently serving a\u00a0life sentencewithout the possibility of parole.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht\n\nSilk Road\u00a0was an online\u00a0black market\u00a0and the first modern\u00a0darknet market, best known as a platform for selling illegal drugs. As part of the\u00a0dark web,\u00a0it was operated as a\u00a0Tor hidden service, such that online users were able to browse it anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring.\n\nUlbricht was indicted on charges of\u00a0money laundering,\u00a0computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic narcotics,\u00a0and attempting to have six people killed.\u00a0Prosecutors alleged that Ulbricht paid $730,000 to others to commit the murders, although none of the murders actually occurred.

Rapists and murders don't even get those charges. \n\nEdit: look I'm not saying he was the most upstanding citizen. I'm not saying he was a good or a bad person. The DPR handle could have been used by any number of people besides him. He took the blame either rightly so or not. His sentencing based on CONVICTIONS not allegations, was too harsh. That is all I'm attempting to say. As far as the hitman allegations go I believe that there is room for discussion as to whether or not those actually took place specifically by him, by someone else, were fabricated, etc. The corruption in this case by federal agents really only leads to people questioning whether or not everything else was done by the book. \n\nI'm not trying to defend him or damn him, I'm just trying to look at it objectively. \n\nAnd yes of course rapists and murders get those charges but it's also common for them to not get two consecutive life sentences.

The entire site had a policy of not selling anything the purpose of which was to harm or defraud others\n\nRoss Ulbricht was never charged for any murder-for-hire or attempted murder-for-hire. Five were dropped, and one charge is parked in Baltimore, but that will never see the light of day because the corruption of Force and Bridges, the two cops involved in the case, was so immense that everything they touched was tainted.\n\n[There is evidence of tampering with the logs](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/new-evidence-suggests-rogue-government-agent-deleted-evidence-in-silk-road-case).

Also, the documentary claims that the \"targets for assassination\" were members of the Silk Road forum that were fictional people created by the investigative team.

I just dont even know what to tell them.\n\nSo I tell them what I am trying to do.\n\nMy goal is to accumulate 1/10 of my mortgage in bitcoin.\n\nI see it as a 50/50 casino bet (roulette wheel RED) w/ an asymmetric 10:1 payout.  I either get mortgage payoff money, or I lose it all.  Anything in between is market noise.  Maybe it takes a year, maybe it takes 15 years.\n\n(As an aside... scaling it to the mortgage balance is telling in another way... if pissing away an amount equal to 1/10 of my mortgage would lead to financial ruin, then I am probably way too leveraged in my house relative to my income.  I have bought way more lifestyle than I can afford and am living way beyond my (low risk) means.  If housing has gone up considerably since I bought in (and I bought more than 3 years ago and can take up to $500k LTCG tax free), I should consider trading down into a less expensive house and using the increased equity from selling tax free to greatly reduce the mortgage on the less expensive house)\n\nAnyhow, my goal is to accumulate that much, buying in blocks, and then to have enough cash (or reasonably liquid capital) reserved to buy massively more in the event of a crash.  Say mortgage is $100k (scale to your own situation).  Own $10k now, say 1btc). But have $10k available to buy a crash.  Maybe 1btc at $5000 and another 3.3btc at $1500.  Maybe even another 5btc at $1000 if you have the capital.  And if it ever sees those prices again.  Nobody really can predict.\n\nBut NOT your life savings, nor all your investment capital.\n\nSo OP, you have achieved the goal.  You own the house, no debt.  Life will look different going forward.  You can spend much less time doing what you have to do, and much more time doing what you choose to do.  Don't quit your job, but do make sure that the job you have is what you \"choose to do for money\".\n", "ah man, just before CME speculators pump it to 20k before december 10th and then short the big geezus out of it :)", "Congratulations, and thank you for posting.

By 1933, a board game had been created much like the version of Monopoly sold by Parker Brothers and its related companies through the rest of the 20th century, and into the 21st.

This gives money linked to it a somewhat arbitrary value and leads to a whole bunch of financial shittyness that I don't want to go into the details of. You want the supply of money be equal to real output in the economy. Hundreds of years ago the amount of gold mined was roughly correlated with real output in the economy, so money was linked to gold and it worked out well enough for the time but by today's standard we would consider still fucking awful. Financial crisis after financial crisis. \n\nWhat you essentially want is the money supply to roughly equal real output in the economy. E.g. If the economy grows 3% in one year, the government prints 3% more money. This would give zero inflation but the government tends to print slightly more than that (which is why there's inflation) to have control over intrest rates, essentially giving policy makers a \"lever\" they can pull up or down at various market cycles to keep the economy stable. Without this ability you're back in the dark ages (literally) and suffering financial crises all the damn time.  \n\nBitcoin is not the same thing as the US dollar or British pound, but you can buy things with it which by definition makes it money. From the lens of bitcoin as money (rather than a security) having a \"limited\" supply that's increases by an exponential decay over time that's completely uncorrelated with economic activity ***is a BAD thing, NOT a good thing - for the same reason we don't link dollars to gold any more.***", "Is this Bitfinex?", "It is all about credit worth.

Bitcoin mining was an ideal algo to run to get the CPUs running as hot and as fast as possible. Perhaps unlike you (*found* hard drive), we kept detailed records of the results, mainly because we wanted to be super critical of how the processors were coping to better than a 1% accuracy. So that in itself meant we never lost track of our Bitcoin blocks or their addresses/keys (Unlike our friend Craig Wright !!).\n\nWhen it became apparent Bitcoins had real value we didn't get excited like most miners as we were running a multimillion pound turnover company and were very busy with other stuff, some of which meant a profit of a million pounds in a week. Bitcoin at a few dollars was nothing, the details got left in the files. \n\nIt was only when Bitcoin exceeded $100 that I started to put a bit of time on them. Looking at the situation with the bitcoin exchanges I made a significant decision - no on exchange dealing until we know the who what and where of the exchange and the people behind it and there is some sort of regulation in place. All exchanges failed our \"integrity\" test, we saw a high percentage of exchanges fold, have bitcoins stolen, operate exit scams, etc over the coming years.\n\nI have therefore only ever sold my Bitcoins face to face for cash. Not a single problem or difficulty and quite appropriate really considering my view that bitcoin is a \"cash equivalent\". Over 50% of initial mined coins now sold at prices between $150 and $1590 dollar equivalent.\n\nWe did try using them to buy a few things from time to time but found it pointless really compared to other existing fiat methods so now its all kept in cold storage until we have another buyer.\n\nAs an experiment I suspect bitcoin has some years to run but personally think it unlikely it will ever become more than a minority interest currency. Certainly if you wanted to design a potential world crypto currency I doubt you would start with bitcoins specific design parameters, many alt coins have taught us there are improvements which can be made.", "Good timing.

So, we are indoctrinated informally by mass media and word of mouth that we live in free-market Capitalism. And most of the US leadership and academia agree with that.\n\nIn realisty, the US system is really a form of Fascism, if you look that up, and has been since at least the FDR days.

At least that is what my high school was like.  We spend 3 months on WW2, Cold-War, Vietnam etc, but we breezed by anything after the wall falling.\n\nIts only 4 years later when I'm about to graduate that I realize the US is not the same country we learned about in Highschool.  A lot has changed in the last 15 years that I fear the general public doesn't comprehend.  People are so distracted by \"Global Warming Fears\", \"Healthcare Policy\", etc, but glaze over the real problem at hand. The current financial state of our country is in peril.  It's so backwards that the only thing officials and bankers can do is feed the beast.  Every year monetary officials stur the stock markets, what they say and report DIRECTLY impacts the global market.  If Janet Yeller came out tomorrow and said our goal for inflation is %5.5 this year, the stock market would react in an extremely predicable manner.  Stakes are so high right now.  I'm not saying that Jannet Yellen is currupt like some of you would think.  Jannet Yellen is in a giant fucking hole.  She has know fucking clue how to fix this mess and her main priority right now is to keep the economy going in a predicable manner.  The primary goal of the Fed right now is to not create panic.  As long as the stock market is climbing 7% they consider themselves good and will do anything to keep it going like that.  Meanwhile, they are inflating our US currencies to reduce the real value of debt they own.  If the US has 10 trillion in some sort of national debt, they can slowly reduce the real value of their debt.  If you have debt, inflation is the best thing for you, because the actual amount of money you owe is reduced along side of it.  This is basically the US's goal at the moment, and no one in thier right mind in the US is admitting that.  Everyone knows this, but no one admits it, because it would create panic.\n\nThis is why the Fed is absolutely terrified of Bitcoin.  If there was a true way to eliminate volitility in the money market they would go bankrupt.  There is no way the Fed could wage their currency war against us and against all foreign countries.  Look how China has begun to act, aiming for a 5% inflation target to increase the growth of their economy.  Now, there are some smart ideas out there of how inflation can actually help a lot of people get out of debt.\n\nOne of the best reasons to have inflation is to help people who are in debt over their heads reduce the real value of their debt.  The idea is that if we can inflate our currency by 4%, every debt an american has to any bank, is reduced by 4%.  However, this only helps people if they are in debt.  For a lot of middle class americans who are not in a terrible financial situation, you are getting robbed blind.  If you don't have most of your money as a loan or asset, your just losing money every year.  You're government is trying to prevent you from saving your money.  They want good housing numbers, they want good consumer spending indices, they want their party to look they are doing a good job, even if the long term effects may be bad.  They are power hungry fools who would try anything to get short term results.\n\ntl;dr Bitcoin is disrupting the foundation of our monetary system and I think its up against a bigger fight than a lot of us are making it out to be.", "Is there a sub for bitcoin news *without* the tea party conspiracy theorists?", "How are banks robbing us?", "\"It's not really funny, is it?\" -- Minister of Silly Walks", "/r/bitcoin posts on the front page of /r/all now?

Changed the post to reflect it. /Edit.\n\nIf bitcoin hits 100k, that means it'll be worth ~25x what it is now.\n\nHow many times has bitcoin been worth 25x what it was previously? Let's see...\n\n[According to the wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin#2011), in Mar 2010 a bitcoin was worth 3 thousandths of one cent. 25x .003 is .075, which is close to .08 (8 cents.) Incidentally, it hit $0.08 in July 2010. That's 1.\n\n25x .075 is about $1.875, or about $2. In Dec 2011, bitcoin price is  reported as being $2. That's 2.\n\n25x 2 is 50. I don't see an exact point where bitcoin is reported at $50 on the wiki, so I looked up a price graph, [here.](https://99bitcoins.com/price-chart-history/) If that graph is accurate, on Mar 18, 2013 bitcoin's price hit $50. That's 3.\n\n25x 50 is $1250. We almost got there in Jan 2014, but not quite. It capped just around $1000 before plummeting, and it didn't fully recover until Jan 2017. Apr 2017 it hit $1250 for the first time (as far as I can tell.) That's 4.\n\nIn 7 years, as of Jan 2017, bitcoin's value has multiplied by 390,625. That's no joke. 25 * 25 * 25 * 25, which is how the math works out here. And that's only getting to $1250. \n\nIt's quite a bit more (over 3x more) if you consider the current value. That's right: bitcoin's value has more than tripled since January of *this year.* If you average the growth from 2010 when the first exchange opened, bitcoin's value has gone up 1,674.1% per year (accounting for tripling so far this year.)\n\nYou wanna prove people wrong, I dunno if hitting another 25x current value will do it.

", "The way I see it, that I haven't seen explained yet here, is that block chain itself will revolutionize the internet and all computer/phone applications. The decentralization, smart contracts, security all add up to be the direction of the future. Bitcoin, and other cryptos, are just one aspect of a blockchain. A tokenization of a blockchain. To execute financial transactions on the future internet or any future application built on blockchain, you will need to use the token that goes along with the blockchain your internet or application is on. Bitcoin and ethereum and a few others will be those tokens (or maybe some crypto yet to be invented). There will be the ability to use multiple different crypto currencies within one blockchain, and this means there will be exchange rates and there will be different reasons to use different cryptos. Eth will be great for complex financial exchanges (stocks, loans, etc). Btc will be a store of value. You might need to move assets between different cryptos depending on the action you are taking.\n\nIn short, the world will be built on blockchain in the future because of the benefits inherent in blockchain. In order to participate in that world, you will need to hold crypto in some form or another because that will be the vehicle for financial transactions.\n\nWe aren't there yet because there has not been enough development and adoption of blockchain apps and internet. The growth and movement towards a blockchain world is what will build the value of cryptocurrencies and that value will stabilize for bitcoin and others, but there will always be new and up coming currencies, just like there are in today's world. The yuan  gains purchasing power, the euro gains purchasing power, it is just that our current currency world is highly matured and the most recent major currency launch was the euro. \n\nBased on my limited understanding at the moment (I am always learning new stuff that changes that opinion), a key indicator to watch to understand future crypto value and practicality are companies like blockstack and others that are building a blockchain based internet and providing a platform for app dev on that chain (I think they are using btc as the token for now).

USD is backed by a government and its military. For some this is why they prefer crypto but in the end we know that USD comes with the strength of the US military. Until governments and their militaries are willing to kill to protect the value of BTC it will never have the same gravitas as something like USD\n\n2. USD and banking systems around it have built in dispute resolution and ways of correcting errors. Wires can be reversed if sent to the wrong account, money can be returned if stolen by fraud etc, whereas with BTC once the money is out of your wallet that's the end of it. Again, for some they consider this a strength of BTC but for practical uses in the real world many times dispute resolution is required and in fact produces the greatest good (even outside of finance exampled by the congested court system)\n\n3.

A dollar today is worth more than a dollar next year, so you'd rather exchange it for goods and services as soon as possible.\n\nWe don't go out and buy groceries with Bitcoin because we know our Bitcoin is most valuable not being spent now than later.  A Bitcoin next year is (in theory for HODLers) worth more than a Bitcoin today, so you'd rather defer goods and services and avoid paying someone with Bitcoin.\n\nThere are pros and cons to each. \n\nEdit: For the record, this is merely an example.  Sure, if I absolutely needed some groceries then I'd absolutely sell whatever assets I had (including Bitcoin) to eat.   Groceries are obviously a bad item to use as an argument since immediate necessities are going to be purchased as required to survive; however, you can replace groceries with some other item.   But part of the reason I don't spend Bitcoin as of yet and so many others just HODL, is because I feel it will be worth more in time - that's all I was getting at.  I could also pay employees or the kid that mows yards in my neighborhood with Bitcoin I've accumulated but then it also in my interest not to pay someone with something I feel will increase in value and instead offer them something that will defeease in value.\n\n\nPeople hoarding Bitcoin for the sole purpose of increasing its value and perpetually just putting off purchases (regardless of what that purchase is) isn't exactly a perfectly better situation than people just spending idiotically due to their currency losing buying power.  \n\n\nThe other problem is accumulation of power through control of the currency.  One of the reason new dollars are pumped into the system exists is to help (perhaps innefficiently) the amount of people who control the currency.  If people could hold all the currency, they'd hold all the power.  So if we have few people who hold a huge amount of Bitcoin (early HODLers) than they have a huge advantage in the control of the currency and power then it puts them in a better position to accumulate and hold even more of it. \n\nSure, government prints our currency and its largely controlled and maintained by banks, there is wealth inequality, so it isnt perfect either, but those institutions just holding onto that cash in a safe or under their mattress would lose value over time.

", "Downside of deflation is that everyone wants to hoard.  Which could be bad for an economy.  In a perfect currency it would maintain value against a basket of items without much fluctuation over time.", "FAKE NEWS!!! Shopping carts were not invented until 1937!", "Bitcoin and other cryptos do not work like traditional money, and it isn't just because they are appreciating in value. \n\nInvesting in a crypto is really investing in its underlying network. In order to use the network, one requires that network's respective currency. Consequently, the more valuable the network becomes, the more demand there is for its native currency. \n\nLikewise, the more valuable bitcoin becomes, the more secure the network becomes and the more demand there is to use the network for crypto-economy projects. We haven't yet seen this demand fully express itself because the scaling war slowed Bitcoin innovation and prevented it from fully opening its doors to realize the demand, but once it does I expect a massive flood into bitcoin. We know the demand is there, look at Ethereum, and once bitcoin makes itself available to that demand it will be a sight to see. \n\nSo investment into Bitcoin is essential for its growth, and its growth is essential to the use of its currency. \n\nThe stronger Bitcoin's network becomes, the more projects and economic infrastructure depends upon it, the more the value of bitcoin becomes entrenched. Once it is understood that the only way for the value of the currency to be destroyed would be for its respective network to be destroyed, and when that network grows to the point of becoming indispensable to society in a way similar to how the internet is today, the reliability of bitcoin's value will seem as secure as the value of the US dollar. At that point one will actually be able to say that bitcoin has something akin to \"intrinsic value\" -- i.e., the concept that a money has value even if it ceases to be used as money.  \n\nSo it is essential to Bitcoin, and all cryptocurrencies, that its underlying currency be deflationary, at least during the growth phase. \n\nIt is also important to point out that the crypto-economy involves many competing currencies, so we are dealing with a fundamentally different beast than national economies that rely on a single currency. **Because anyone is free to print their own money in the crypto-economy, it is vital that the base currencies be deflationary.** \n\nIn fiat systems, you want a small amount of inflation to encourage lending and discourage loan defaults. When banks lend money, they do so by \"printing\" new money into existence. What prevents the system from spiraling into hyper-inflation is that money is destroyed when people repay their debts. Because there is always more debt in existence than money (since debt = money + interest) there has to be a constant rate of inflation to allow there to always be enough money to repay the debts. \n\nIn the crypto-economy, by contrast, new money is printed into existence without usually having a way of being destroyed. This problem is obviated by the fact that new money usually comes in the form of new types of currencies, it isn't a printing of existing currencies. If someone wishes to print new money, for instance, they must create a new token, give it a new name, and sell it (e.g., through an ICO). The money supply of existing currencies isn't being affected by the expansion of the money supply in the crypto-economy. \n\nWhat this means is that the crypto-economy itself must discourage over-exuberance since there is no risk involved in creating one's own currency. That discouragement comes from the fact that established currencies are deflationary, and therefore new projects must be able to prove that they can outperform existing platforms. Because the crypto-economy is a competitive free-market, competition between currencies makes it so that monetary policy from a single institution aimed at artificially recreating the conditions of a free market is not required. \n\n", "This is meaningless unless you think putting cash in a mattress is a good way to save money. Interest rates offset inflation and other investments exist that far exceed the rate of inflation. Cash is meant to be used, not stored.\n\nHow about doing the same set of images, but make it represent income instead.\n\nYou'd have growing piles of cash for dollars, and shrinking piles of bitcoin.\n\nIt's this psychological effect that has made economists decide that inflation is a good thing.", "This is good for investments, not so much for currencies", "This doesn't make any sense.", "In the mid 60's 25 bucks would fill a grocery cart with food for five for a week.

The wall can also be more appropriately interpreted as a market \u2018ask\u2019 wall that the bull is hammering down and must overcome. The wall contains hints of green to symbolize the current USD paradigm. The painting also features warmer tones to emphasize on the stresses, frustrations, and uncertainties of the market. \n\n-----------\n\nWe are also releasing 21 limited edition copies that are signed and numbered.

Banks aren't in the check-cashing or payment processing 'business'- they may derive some fee-based income from those services, but it's hardly their bread and butter. Banks are in the business of money rental. They pay you to park your funds with them, first literally via dividends (with more available the more locked in those funds are), then via incentivizing services like check issuance, peer to peer payments, online banking, billpay, etc. Those services are only an inducement to deposit, and all of those things are EXPENSES to the bank. They willingly pay them to secure the capital which they then promptly lend out. That's how they earn the lion's share of their income, and the better they strike the right balance of securing it for relatively little while lending as much of it out as safely possible, the more successful they become. They want to reward you for depositing cash with them so they can lend it out, and yeah, so they can cross-sell you more means by which you'll borrow (or earn interchange fees). But either way, that cash is promptly going right back out again at an advantageous rate of return. \n\nBitcoin isn't an existential threat to that model. It could cause a disruption to the service incentive piece of the puzzle that helps banks secure cash, but they have many means of earning those deposits.

However, the vast majority of the benefits are still theoretical.

Banks and hedge funds on the other hand are not - they want to lock in profits. And looking at the way volume has been fluctuating recently it's clear that big money is involved. You can see when they enter and exit. You can even see really odd repeating volume patterns.  At some point selling volume will accelerate as more people exit to try exit with a large short-term gain.\n\nIf this happens (and it has done so going back several years), the next pullback will get us to the 4500/5000 range. Again, don't freak out if this happens. It's not a sign that something is wrong. It's just an inevitable outcome, emerging out of the psychology of buying and selling and making profit.  \n\nIf you freak at 5000 and exit, you'll miss the next run - the one that will get us to the 12000/14000 range.\n\nEdit: It's 8PM, Eastern Standard, November 1, 2017.

Tragedy of the commons means that miners are in a perpetual race to own the fastest hardware possible and this keeps them coming back. \n\nIn order to make most profit from mining hardware, mining has to be at the extreme upper limit of being just barely profitable, so that hardware prices can be kept up. i.e. miners have to mine continuously at a high price in order to cover their electricity and hardware costs. This means gaming the system so that they mine only expensive blocks when the difficulty is comparatively low to their hardware capability. What to do when blocks are below cost price (e.g. after a difficulty bump)? They still have to pay off their hardware investment.\n\nFind something else to mine. This is BCH. By switching from BTC to BCH and back, and judicious use of price manipulation and leverage on the alternate currency, mining pools can continue to make sufficient money by mining BCH when it's high and pushing BTC price down.\n\nThey probably can't mine BCH indefinitely since it doesn't have a viable ecosystem apart from pure speculation. Therefore they will probably have to switch back to BTC at some point, probably when the difficulty/price ratio is more attractive.\n\nHowever this fluctuation in the block generation time caused by their gaming the system is damaging to BTC. Bitcoin core need to urgently consider ways of addressing it, either by finding a way to either reward loyal miners/punish defectors or by making changes to the difficulty adjustment in a way that doesn't itself create an alternative way of gaming the system by an adversary.", "From past 24 hours, we can see:\n1.

The wealth being created by our getting better at making things, a natural deflationary force, and the natural state of a technological soceity,  is being skimmed by the banks printing money.\n\n2. The reason the gold system of the 1930's collapsed was that it was a fractional reserve gold system where we printed more notes than we had gold backing them.\n\nPoint 2 is widely misunderstood.  Lots of people who consider themselves well read in economics say that the financial chaos of the 1930s was a result of our being on a gold standard coupled with deflation that got out of control.  If only the FED were not on a gold standard, they could have printed enough money to turn the deflation around.\n\nPoint 1 is even more deeply, and widely, misunderstood.\n\nIt was hard to displace fiat money systems once they became firmly established.\n\nThe combination of uniquitous wireless networking and smart phones, however, allows for the distributed public ledger solution which opens up the whole field of currency and payment systems to competetion and innovation.\n\nI suspect that bitcoin is going to give rise to lots of currencies and payment concepts that we have barely glimsped so far.

This could be a fantastic post, but its filled with half truths. It demonstrates a serious misunderstanding of monetary policy and central banking. People would do well in understanding the effects of deflation and a deflationary spiral before trying to criticize banking and monetary policy. It is a very complicated subject. Do you love bitcoin? Do you have strong opinions about banking? Then don't be lazy, stop reading simple web articles written by individuals or organizations pushing for an agenda or biased anarchists unable to see the two sides of a coin, apply yourself, and dive into economics and history. The gold standard was deflationary, an economic aberration. Rigid monetary systems are only positive in the absence of disciplined and independent central banking. Bitcoin is awesome, I both invest and trade in bitcoin and other cryptos, but that does not mean that bitcoin replacing fiat currencies would be any good, because bitcoin's rigid supply makes it deflationary. Do you hold fiat and are concerned about your fiat losing value? Well, you don't have to! Fiat is not meant to be held for the long term. Invest it! Buy bonds, buy stocks, open a term deposit, buy bitcoin, whatever. Fiat is meant to serve as a stable means of exchange that promotes a healthy economy. That means avoiding deflation at all costs. That means promoting credit. That 2% is very necessary. A necessary evil for some, yet still very necessary. Do you have doubts? Then try to visualize what would happen if you take a mortgage to buy your first home, and then deflation kicks in and the price of your house starts dropping at a rate of 5% every year. You have a fixed mortgage interest rate; your interest payments are fixed, but the value of your home is going down. What happens? Now lets say on top of that your employers' sales are dropping because there is deflation and prices are dropping; the employer is unable to pay salaries, so it turns around, fires 10% of the employees, and cuts your salary by 10%. Now you have fixed interest payments, a house that is dropping in value, a lower salary, you may be about to get fired any day, and if you don't your salary is likely to continue going down as more and more people get fired and there are more people out there looking for less and less jobs.

["Protestors are using using a P2P mesh network (Firechat) in Hong Kong to coordinate and not get shut down. Have you ever seen anything more powerful than this image?", "2014-09-30T15:01:57", 5079, 511, ["Hong Kong Protesters are using mesh-net on a widescale right now. Meshnets grow stronger with more users. The Old-School Traditional Internet is connected at the core through \"BackBones\" which are owned and operated by corporate, government, military interests. These backbones are centralized points of failure that can be exploited or manipulated. In addition, the cables and frequencies that the internet is transmitted over are owned by corporate/government interests, taking another point of control away from the people.\n\nThe Meshnet is a concept embodied by many technologies and services. The main idea is to use overlapping WiFi signals on cellphones, routers, laptops, etc to create a new Internet that cannot be censored or controlled. You may be saying to yourself \"But there will be many connectivity gaps and at some point the meshnet will need to connect to the traditional Internet\" This is where Bitcoin and the Cryptographic revolution come in.\n\nSome Protocols for the Meshnet are now maturing, things like BitCloud, and MaidSafe. \n\nThese Protocols incentivize people to provide bandwidth, storage, and servers to the meshnet. The protocols use cryptographic techniques that allow people to a) Prove that they something of value, harddrive space for instance, and b) Receive payment for providing the service.\n\nThe data on the meshnet is orders of magnitude more secure, both in privacy and in reliability. Data is encrypted and broken in millions or billions of bits and those bits are copied and spread throughout the meshnet like grains of sand. No one place stores a full copy of your data, yet many, many copies of your data exist.\n\nThe more traffic your facilitate on your network, the more Bitcoins (or \"local\" crypto) you are paid. The more space your provide for storage, the more cloud computing power, the more you are paid.\n\nJust like Bitcoin mining, we will see an arms race to provide network connectivity, storage space, computing power, at cheaper and cheaper prices. The charts below are the amount of computing power invested into the Bitcoin network in the:\n\n1) Past Year https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate\n2) Past 2 Years https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate?timespan=2year&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=\n\n3) Past 5 Years  https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=\n\nThis is the kind of accelerated growth we will see when the Meshnet is given the proper incentives.\n\nThis is a real chance for meaningful revolution without any kind of war. I say it is a revolution because it overturns the control of information and financial systems.\n\nIt also empowers individuals to be paid by a non-human entity. You work for the protocol and the protocol rewards everyone fairly without taking a cut for itself. Yes, its still funded by humans paying into the system, but its a different kind of control system.\n\nInformation, Coinage, Employment. These systems are ripe for inversion. The traditional systems will simply become less relevant and the new systems more profitable, more relevant. It will be analogous to the industrial revolution. Agricultural and traditional jobs simply became less relevant compared to industrial jobs.\n\nYou might think to yourself \"The powers that be wont take this sitting down\" and I say to that; they are certainly running out of time to do anything about stopping it. The nature of these programs is that there is no single point of failure. In order to stop it they must stop everyone who is using these programs. And as they stop people, it becomes more and more profitable for those who keep running, just further incentivizing it. These programs are all open-source, which allows anyone to review the code at anytime. This results in secure code devoid of \"backdoors.\"\n\nAt this point there are only 3 options I envision that will keep the Cryptographic revolution from occurring.\n\n1) Solar Flare/Gamma Ray Burst/International Pandemic (Rare Life Ending Events; Non human based)\n2) Outright War on Cryptography which ends in full Dark Age; Possible WW3\n3) Quantum Computers developed in the future are able to decrypt classical encryption. However Quantum Computers would also be able to create unbreakable encryption, which could lead the way to a new Cryptographic revolution.\n\nI see #3 as the most probable of these scenarios, but practical Quantum Computing is still decades out and even then we may be able to anticipate developments in Quantum Cryptography that allow a transition to the new system before opportunists. It would seem that if the first Cryptographic revolution is successful then Quantum Computers would be developed for the express purpose of aiding the Protocol rather than destroying it.\n\n\nThe Hong Kong Protests may be the ignition to set the revolution off. Meshnets need users, the more users, the stronger and faster they are. Once meshnets break a certain thresh-hold they will be an attractive Internet option.\n\nInstead of paying an ISP, you will load Bitcoin into your Meshnet router. Each packet of data will have a tiny fraction of Bitcoin attached to it. You can offset your internet costs by making some harddrive space available or allowing your router to be used as a node to facilitate other peoples traffic.

Segwit2x found its first success in August, as it broke the deadlock and quickly led to Segwit\u2019s successful activation.

Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together. Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean blocksize upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin\u2019s growth. This was never the goal of Segwit2x.\n\n>As fees rise on the blockchain, we believe it will eventually become obvious that on-chain capacity increases are necessary. When that happens, we hope the community will come together and find a solution, possibly with a blocksize increase. Until then, we are suspending our plans for the upcoming 2MB upgrade. We want to thank everyone that contributed constructively to Segwit2x, whether you were in favor or against. Your efforts are what makes Bitcoin great.

Since that time, the team\nshifted its efforts to phase two of the project - a 2MB blocksize increase.\n\n>Our goal has always been a smooth upgrade for Bitcoin.  Although we\nstrongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we\nbelieve is even more important: **keeping the community together.**\nUnfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for\na clean blocksize upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path\ncould divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin\u2019s growth. This was\nnever the goal of Segwit2x.\n\n>As fees rise on the blockchain, we believe it will eventually become\nobvious that on-chain capacity increases are necessary. When that happens,\n**we hope the community will come together and find a solution, possibly with\na blocksize increase. Until then, we are suspending our plans for the\nupcoming 2MB upgrade.**\n\n>We want to thank everyone that contributed constructively to Segwit2x,\nwhether you were in favor or against.

Polis & Schweikert introduce Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act in Congress\nBipartisan bill will make it much easier to use Bitcoin to pay for every day goods and services. \n\nBY JERRY BRITO / September 7, 2017\n\nIn April, Coin Center explained how the tax laws affecting digital currency transactions create serious friction for consumers and merchants and discourages the use of Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) as an everyday payment method. We also outlined how Congress could address this problem. Since then we have been working with congressional staff to develop legislation that would address the problem, and today I\u2019m thrilled that with the leadership of Rep. Jared Polis and Rep. David Schweikert, co-chairs of the Blockchain Caucus, the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act has been introduced in Congress.\n\nThe bill does two things. First, it creates a de minimis exemption for cryptocurrency transactions for goods or services. Today, if you buy a cup of coffee with bitcoins, you\u2019ll have to calculate and report any gains that you experienced and pay tax on any gains. Under the bill, any transaction under $600 would be completely exempt, so you\u2019d neither have to worry about keeping track of gains on all the little purchases you make, nor would you owe taxes on those small gains. This mirrors the same kind of exemption that foreign currency enjoys today and we think it\u2019s a simple and fair way to avoid discouraging the use of cryptocurrency.\n\nNow, there are many other transactions above $600, such as getting in and out of investment positions, on which capital gains tax will be owed. Today, you are responsible for keeping track of and accurately reporting every cent of gain. This is in contrast to your stock broker, who provides you and the IRS with a 1099-B form accounting all your gains and losses. Indeed, in answering Coin Center\u2019s amicus brief opposing the IRS\u2019s unprecedented and overbroad John Doe summons against Coinbase users, the Department of Justice noted that, \u201cIf Congress had subjected bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase to similar reporting requirements as those imposed on an online stock broker or a barter exchange, no John Doe summons to Coinbase would likely have been necessary[.]\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re not sure if such informational reporting requires an act of Congress, or whether the IRS could have provided for it through rulemaking and has simply opted not to. Whatever the case, the other thing the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act would do is require the Treasury Department to issue guidelines for informational reporting on digital currency transactions for which capital gains is due.\"\n\n\nNow is the time to write to our Congressmen and Senators!  Handwritten, old school-style letters via US Mail get their attention more than email.  It's worth the effort.

Herd those animals, send 'em down the chute. hahaha.", "So how are they taxing transactions over $600 atm, ", "Does this apply to cashing out, i.e. selling Bitcoin for fiat?

The administrative burden that would exist for the government to verify all these transaction may bring it to its knees (and of course be impossible). Not sure that bugs me too much.

Thats simply not their business, we live in the cryptoworld, which is and always should be outside the reach of us Government law and the enforcement entities.\nThe US Government does not provide any useful services for the cryptocommunity (the actually slow down the development), so that they dont have a legitimate right to charge or to tax or get sth. out of it.\nTechnically we should keep our privacy, so even if they want to tax they simply cannot do that.\n\nImao", "I hope this passes.

Why risk so much on something so speculative when their are so many ways to grow your money with much less risk? Once you have money to invest the name of the game is \"asset protection.\"  Taking your hard earned money and getting emotional about any one investment has shown time and time and time again to be a bad strategy for accumulating wealth.

Yet to buy into bitcoin you had to trust all the exchanges, because where else were you going to get the exact amount you wanted?  \n\nThat was my biggest complaint about bitcoin, the whole infrastructure seemed taped together with duct tape and always has.  Even when I wanted to get involved I didn't simply because we aren't dealing with the New York Stock Exchange.  The government tries to make trading fair, but to do that it has to play a somewhat direct role in businesses.  In most cases the government tries to make investing and trading fair for everyone involved (I know the government can be untrustworthy too, but the SEC does more good than harm at the end of the day), what protections do people have concerning Mt. Gox?\n\nIf something like the SEC was allowed to look into Mt. Gox and found everything was in working order I would have at least a little bit of trust.

Can you imagine how tempting it must have been to possess control over this wealth but no ownership?  \n\nI barely trust banks or services like Scottrade, and everyone involved in things like that are licensed and watched very carefully.  Yet it would seem Mt. Gox found countless people to buy into the hype train while ignoring common sense.  That common sense?  A Magic the Gathering card game website and the people who ran it were not equipped to deal with a fucking exchange this large.  Even professional exchanges experience hiccups from time to time, what did people expect the Mt. Gox crew to be doing?  Carefully handling all these millions?  \n\nSerious question, does this mean Bitcoin is dead?  I can't imagine anyone trusting these illegitimate exchanges anymore.\n\nTalk shit about things like the SEC all you want but I guarantee you those running Mt.

Please do note, that it was written almost 10 years ago and a lot of innovation has happened in Bitcoin since.

If you understand that and the basics of the ledger, I think that's a good place to start if the white paper is too dense. ", "The problem with this paper is, it is primarily intended as a functional explanation of a technical proposal, i.e. to make a bitcoin system, not an in-depth discussion of a economic model. \n\nIt makes a couple of assumptions at the beginning (trust-based models are inherently weak, a cryptographic model is fundamentally more secure) then dives right in. While those assumptions aren't incorrect, they're also not precise. If a trust based model is 99.9999% secure, and bitcoin is 99.99999999999% secure, that's a small but substantive difference. There are real situations where that difference will matter. But if the security needs of 99.99999999% of users is 98%, it's meaningless. \n\nThe point being: understanding bitcoin from a technical perspective is important, but so is understanding it in an economics context. Don't just read this paper and think 'oh wow, Bitcoin is totally the future' and rush out and needlessly sink all your money into it. Understand what it's good for (some online transactions), bad for (you won't be buying groceries with it soon), and useable-but-no-real-advantage for (if you're buying $95 worth of stuff on Amazon, it will take you longer to use a workaround than your time is worth; you won't increase security, you'll just lose time).

Reading comprehension is key. I described a extremely common form of purchasing activity for which bitcoin is currently unsuited. And even if Amazon made the switch to accept it, that still wouldn't address the underlying issue that using bitcoin requires extra steps for no real increase in security. \n\nIf you want to do certain types of grey area payments, bitcoin is superb: it's secure, it's quick, it's reliable, it anonymous. If you want to do the bulk of mainstream purchases, it's a little like putting five padlocks on your front door - sure, it gets the job done, but...why? \n\nIf you're trying to mainstream bitcoin - which is what your post seemed aimed at - you need to address that as well, not just the technical side of how it works.

What a time to be alive!", "What's interesting is that any attempt at regulation will be for a version of Bitcoin that won't even exist at the time said regulations are eventually enacted.\n\nThere is a high probability that any attempt to regulate open source financial software will result in the regulators looking quite foolish in the end.", "all in", "[deleted]", "\"Legalize\", as if it's a drug.", "**What government get if they constrain bitcoin?**\n\nThey can keep extracting wealth from its citizens by printing more FIAT.\nThey can keep extracting wealth from its citizens by controlling money flow and taking (overblown) taxes.\n\n**What government lose if they constrain bitcoin?**\n\nIt's citizens will miss on buying new global asset when it is cheap and that will basically destroy that country economically in the world where bitcoin is becoming more and more popular. For example when Bolivians finally starts to buy bitcoins in couple of years they will have to pay $10.000, $15.000, $20.000 for something that rest of the world buys now for $3000 (not to mention that smartest/luckiest bought it for way less). That would be financial suicide for Bolivia.\nSince governments are not stupid, there is only couple of governments in the world that are really banning bitcoin and other cryptos.\n\n**Why would Average Joe wanted to deal with Bitcoin?**\n\nBecause bitcoins will not lose value over time. It only makes sense to keep any savings in a currency that losses as little value as possible over time. Citizens who lives in countries with good currencies with low inflations like EUR/USD don't really understand this ATM, however rest of the world only keeps pocket money (like one month salary) in domestic currency and all savings in better currencies like USD/EUR. Citizens of those less fortunate countries often do business directly with better currency if able and even price things in better currency with disclaimer \"paid with local (shitty) currency with exchange rate at the time of buying\". Anyways, if bitcoin becomes stable and widely used he will have smaller inflation (even negative inflation) then any FIAT currency and therefor become default choice for any savings everywhere. Not to mention that it is permissionless, borderless, and all other good things. Problem is that citizens of countries with shitty currencies are not early technology adopters. It just takes a bit more time for them to get infrastructure and right mind set.

(Although the arrest occurred in the Poland, it was driven by a complaint filed in the District Court in Chicago, and Vaulin is being extradited to the U.S.).The change to Rule 41 is designed to attack Tor through its user base.
